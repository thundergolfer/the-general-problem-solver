# The General Problem Solver Program

Herbert Simon, J.C Shaw and Allen Newell's General Problem Solver Program (GPS) is one of the earliest AI program in existence, succeeding the [Logic Theorist Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist) which arguably was the first AI program. The repo contains implementations of the GPS in multiple programming languages.

### Languages Implemented So Far

* [Common Lisp](/general_problem_solver.lisp)
* [Python](/general_problem_solver.py)
* [Java](/general_problem_solver.java)
* [C](/general_problem_solver_C/) (In Progress...)  
* [C++](/gps_cpp/) 

### Other Resources For Understanding

* [Description of the Program in Natural Language](/natlang_GPS_description.txt)
* [Norvig's retrospective on PAIP, and comments on the continuing relevance of LISP](http://norvig.com/Lisp-retro.html)
